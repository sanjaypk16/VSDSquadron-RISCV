# Research Internship on VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board
**About:**
The internship is based on RISC-V Development Board(VSDSquadron Mini),which is a flagship product of VLSI System Design.It is a 4-week internship program on RISC-V.
The program has three types of internship
1.Beginners
2.Intermediate
3.Advanced.
My internship is on Beginner(VLSI), which is on VLSI.
